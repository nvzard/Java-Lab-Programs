    Q2.Design an interface named infacex, with the method reverse that reverses
    the digits of a number. Write a main class to test this interface.

    Q3.Create an interface named shape that contains method named as number of 
    sides. Provide 3 classes named trapezoid, triange and hexagon, such that each
    one of the classes contains only the method no. of sides(that contains no. of
    sides in the given geometrical figure. Write a main class to test all these
