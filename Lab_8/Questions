    Further extend this class and create another class student_etc that will
    inherit method and variables of student_info class and having following
    data members i.e marks and attendance. It consists of method display to
    show marks and attendance along with other details. Write a main class
    to test all these classes with necessary constructors.

Q2. Create a class names employee with the following details.
    var :Name, address
